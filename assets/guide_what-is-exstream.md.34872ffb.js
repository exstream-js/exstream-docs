It builds on top of plain Node.js modules, and enforces the use of a &quot;light-functional&quot; programming paradigm. With Exstream it is possible to build memory efficient data flows in a clean and readable way, being them simple or complex.</p><p>Here is a minimal example:</p><div class="language-js"><button class="copy"></button><span class="lang">js</span><pre><code><span class="line"><span style="color:#C792EA;">const</span><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"> _ </span><span style="color:#89DDFF;">=</span><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"> </span><span style="color:#82AAFF;">require</span><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">(</span><span style="color:#89DDFF;">&#39;</span><span style="color:#C3E88D;">Exstream.js</span><span style="color:#89DDFF;">&#39;</span><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">)</span></span>

This happens because we&#39;re seeking to strike a pragmatic balance between the clear undeniable benefits of FP, and the need to ship workable, maintainable JS. JavaScript is, in fact, not a pure FP language in that, for example, it lacks immutability.</p><p>Check out the cool ebook <a href="https://github.com/getify/Functional-Light-JS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Functional Light JS</a> by <a href="https://github.com/getify" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kyle Simpson</a> if you want to know more about FP in Javascript</p></div><ul><li><b>A simple, well-known API</b>: this example is almost equal, with minimum differences, to a <a href="https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#chain" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">lodash chain</a> and is also very similar to the code you would write in plain javascript. But as we will see in this guide, with Exstream you can do a lot more, joining together streams and asynchronous transformation and controlling the data flow, using the same clean syntax</li></ul><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">Prerequisites</p><p>The rest of the documentation assumes basic familiarity with Node.js, Promises, Array functional methods and Node.js Streams. If you are totally new to these topics, it might not be the best idea to jump right into this library as your first step - grasp the basics and then come back! You can check your knowledge level with the <a href="./getting-started.html">Getting started</a> section.

Also writing a minimum complex chain of asynchronous tasks is not trivial when you have to take care of rate limiting, throttling, partial parallelism, error handling, etc.</p><p>The idea behind this library is not new. Some years ago I discovered a beatiful library called <a href="https://caolan.github.io/highland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Highland</a>, that does essentially the same thing Exstream does. The reasons why I wrote Exstream are essentially 3:</p><ul><li>Highland is abandoned (no more commits from 2019)</li><li>Highland was written before Promise was a first class citizien, and even before ES5</li><li>There were lot of open issues (affecting also myself)</li></ul><p>Exstream share some similarities with highland in its API, but it&#39;s a rewrite from scratch with also many differences and improvements:</p><ul><li>A better handling of synchronous tasks</li><li>A better handling of promises</li><li>It is generally faster</li><li>The API can be easily extendend</li><li>It ships powerful high level functions (like CSV parsing/serializing, streaming join, groupBy of sorted data sets, and others)</li><li>It does not suffer of many bugs that are open since years</li></ul><p>That said, a great tribute to caolan for his brilliant work, hoping that this library can continue where Highland left off</p>`,17),l=[o];function i(r,p,c,h,d,m){return e(),s("div",null,l)}const f=a(n,[["render",i]]);export{u as __pageData,f as default};
